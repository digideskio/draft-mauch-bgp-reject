        <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
            <t>
                BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> speakers have many default
                settings which need to be revisited as part of improving the
                routing ecosystem.  There is a need to provide guidance to BGP
                implementers for the default behaviors of a well functioning
                Internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation" />
                are part of the problem, but software defects and operator
                misconfigurations are just a few of the attacks on Internet
                stability we aim to address.
            </t>

            <t>
                Many BGP speakers accept all routes from a neighbor by
                default. This practice dates back to the early days of the
                Internet, where operators were permissive in offering routing
                information to allow all networks to reach each other. As
                the Internet has become more densely interconnected, the
                risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses significant risks
                to Internet routing.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification intends to improve this situation by
                requiring the explicit configuration of a BGP import
                and export policy for any EBGP speaking session such
                as customers, peers, or confederation boundaries in
                a base router or VPN instances.  When this solution is
                implemented, devices will no longer accept or send routes
                without policies configured on EBGP sessions.

            <t>The following requirements apply to the solution described in this document:
                <list style="symbols">

                    <t>Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an EBGP peer, if no export policy was configured.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST provide protection from internal failures preventing the advertisement and acceptance of routes.</t>
                    <t>Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this security capability.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST operate in this mode by default.</t>
                </list>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document addresses the basic security posture of a BGP
                speaking device within a network. Operators have a need for
                implementers to address the problem through a behavior change
                to mitigate against possible attacks from a permissive security
                posture.  Attacks and inadvertent advertisements cause business
                impact necessitating this default behavior.
